Greetings Internet traveler!

To those who stumble upon my blog, my name is Josh, and I'm a simple engineer blogging about random hardware, software, and other aspects within technology. 

As many like me who grew up with a computer in front of them growing up in the 90s; games and technology have gotten me hooked on building and disassembling hardware and mashing software together in ways that were intended or unintended lol.


As I'm learning `Ruby` to as well as `Jekyll` to write about random things, please excuse random wierd issues to popup.
