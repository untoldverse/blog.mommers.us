A short describption about me:


I began my tech journey with networking: It was really interesting early on as it was basically learning logic to steer traffic from one point to the other (my father was OG network engineer which he help me get alot of hands on early Cisco gear to build and play with).

Eventually I discover hypervisors in highschool as they star ted to emerge and UNIX operating systems which were RHEL and FreeBSD at the time which sunk my time into. I still was using a Windows PC as I grew up playing games on Windows and XP->7 were the days to play awesome games such as Supreme Commander and other RTS games. I also started to heavyly gfet into consumer hardware as building PCs got me starting to learn about system hardware.

Eventually I switched fully to Linux by the Windows 10 rolled out, and I was working in a QA/Test Lab for Security/Network gear which catapult me into Enterprise technology. From ESXI/Linux/Network gear that really allowed me to test/configure/ and learn about best practices regarding deployment and security implications. I've also started to really learn python at this point.


I'm currently learning and trying to improve my coding/software experience from a professional standpoint. Scripting languages such as bash/terraform (yes I count it scripting) I really like Linux/FreeBSD - as there are MUCH more tech options to do in these systems. !

Languages:
`Python`
`Golang`
`Rust`
`Zig/OCAML` (In the Process for Zig/OCAML!)

I really dislike that getting access to firmware/network images from vendors are really hard to acuire to learn and test (especially when you are playing with APIs)

Side-note: I love playing games, mostly co-op and single player games now. I used to love to play MMOs (Everquest/Lineage/FFXI) - but the genre has lost its' soul in my opinion. I really like playing "arcade" games since its simple and hard to do and rhythm games like DJMax!
